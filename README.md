# Overview of the analysis:
The main purpose of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In this analysis, we used Pandas to change the data type of the “trip duration” column from an integer to a DateTime data type to get the time in hours and minutes. Once this was completed we uploaded the new CSV into tableau with the converted trip duration column.


# Results:
